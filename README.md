# SmallEmotionBot
A small (and mostly untrained) text-based emotion analysis bot. Uses a linear regression model with a logistic activation function and 11 Individual Neurons to attempt to capture 11 different emotions

# This model uses very high dimensions to accomplish this. In future, I would reduce the dimentionality of weight vectors

# NOTE: This is currently set up to run on a Windows Device, check comments at the top of cpython.c and cpython_calculations files to modify for mac os

# The code used to train the tokenizer for the model, as well as the tokenizer look-up table are also present. There is also an empty "token_data.txt" file which stores the embedded tokens
